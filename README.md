## ⚙️ Procedure

1. **Frontend:**
   - Designed a user-friendly form using **HTML** and **CSS**.
   - Applied **JavaScript validation** to check inputs like name, email, and phone number before submission.

2. **Backend:**
   - Used **Java** for server-side processing.
   - Connected the frontend to a **MySQL database** using **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**.
   - Ensured proper **input validation and formatting** before storing data.

3. **Database:**
   - Data is securely stored in a **MySQL table** with constraints to ensure integrity (e.g., unique email, valid phone format).
